# WebAPI

Previously, I have engaged with APIs in various projects, yet I had not ventured into creating one independently. Recently, I successfully developed my own API, which is accessible through the Postman API app for calling API methods within my application. Through this endeavor, I gleaned that at its core, an API primarily comprises POST and GET methods, enabling third-party applications to invoke them with accessible parameters or without. To facilitate JSON handling within my API, I leveraged NuGet packages such as Newtonsoft.Json and ASP.NET Core Newtonsoft.Json.
